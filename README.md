### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   Docker and Docker Compose
*   A GitHub Personal Access Token (optional, for higher rate limits)

current prerequisites: python 3.10+

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gh-archive-dashboard.git
    cd gh-archive-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Start the services with Docker Compose**
    ```bash

3.  **Access the applications**
    *   Dashboard: Open http://localhost:8501
    *   API Docs: Open http://localhost:8000/docs

## 💡 Usage

Once the dashboard is running, you can:
*   View a real-time chart of the most popular programming languages on GitHub.
*   See a live feed of the most recently starred repositories.
*   Watch a leaderboard of the most active users in the past hour.

## 🔭 Future Ideas

*   [ ] Add user configurable alerts (e.g., "Notify me if a repo gets more than 100 stars in an hour").
*   [ ] Incorporate sentiment analysis on commit messages.
*   [ ] Deploy the entire pipeline on AWS/Azure cloud.
